# OpenMind


OpenMind is an IOS app that allows the user to essentially blog their everyday lives through text journals or voice memos. By recording your everyday iteration with the app, you remind yourself that you're only growing as a human. The goal of this app is to blog yourself, whether it be a good or bad day, the goal is to see how you're doing overtime and eventually provide various methods of self-care to help with mental health.

Our inspiration for this app came from our everyday life interaction from work to school. College is a stressful time and we often long for different ways to take care of ourselves. Part of growing up is taking on everyday challenges and there will be times where those days can have you feeling high in the sky to low in the dumps. Regardless, we always need something to essentially vent out or frustrations or remind us of our successes. Enter our app, OpenMind.
